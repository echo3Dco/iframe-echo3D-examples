HTML example files that show how to embed echo3D into a website or an app using iframe.

## Register
If you don't have an echo3D API key yet, make sure to register for FREE at [echo3D](https://console.echo3D.co/#/auth/register).

## Setup
* [Add the 3D model](https://docs.echo3D.co/quickstart/add-a-3d-model) from the [models](https://github.com/echo3Dco/AR.js-echo3D-COVID19/tree/master/models) folder to the console.
* Replace the api key and the entry ID in the html files with your own api key and entry ID that can be found in console. 

## Run
Open the code locally on a server like MAMP or simply import all code into online platform like Glitch or Codepen to try the demo right away.

## Notes
 * When you use browser to try the demo make sure you use HTTPS to avoid any problem on camera accessibility.
